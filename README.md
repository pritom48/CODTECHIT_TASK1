Overview of Password Strength Checker Project

Project Title: Password Strength Checker

Objective:
The Password Strength Checker project aims to develop a tool that evaluates the strength of user-entered passwords and provides feedback to help users create more secure passwords. This tool analyzes various aspects of passwords, including length, complexity, and uniqueness, to determine their robustness against potential attacks.

Key Features:--

1. Length Check:
   - Verifies if the password meets the minimum length requirement (e.g., at least 8 characters).

2. Complexity Analysis:
   - Ensures the password includes a mix of character types:
     - Lowercase letters (a-z)
     - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
     - Digits (0-9)
     - Special characters (e.g., @, #, $, %, ^, &, +, =)
  
3. Uniqueness Check:
   - Ensures the password contains a minimum number of unique characters.

4. Common Password Detection:
   - Compares the password against a list of commonly used and easily guessable passwords.

5. Entropy Calculation:
   - Calculates the entropy of the password to assess its randomness and unpredictability.

6. Feedback Mechanism:
   - Provides specific feedback on how to improve the password's strength based on the analysis.

Implementation:

The Password Strength Checker will be implemented in Python, leveraging regular expressions and basic algorithms to evaluate the passwords. 



Usage: Users will enter their passwords into the tool, which will then evaluate the password based on the criteria and provide a score or rating (e.g., Weak, Moderate, Strong, Very Strong). Additionally, users will receive actionable feedback on how to improve their password strength.

Benefits:

1. Enhanced Security:
   - Helps users create stronger, more secure passwords, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

2. User Education:
   - Educates users on the importance of password complexity and security best practices.

3. Automated Analysis:
   - Provides an automated, consistent method for evaluating password strength.
